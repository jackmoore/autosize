## Autosize

Small jQuery plugin to allow dynamic resizing of textarea height, so that it grows as based on visitor input.  To use, just call the `.autosize()` method on any textarea element. Example `$('textarea').autosize();`.  See the [project page](http://jacklmoore.com/autosize/) for documentation and a demonstration.  Released under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

## Changelog

### Version 1.15 - November 16, 2012
* Reworked to only create a single mirror element, instead of one for each textarea.
* Dropped feature detection for FF3 and Safari 4.

### Version 1.14 - October 6, 2012
* Added 'append' option for appending whitespace to the end of the height calculation (an extra newline improves the apperance when animating).
* Added a demonstration of animating the height change using a CSS transition.

### Version 1.13 - September 21, 2012
* Added optional callback that fires after resize.

### Version 1.12 - September 3, 2012
* Fixed a bug I introduced in the last update.

### Version 1.11 - August 8, 2012
* Added workaround to get Chrome to reflow default text better.

### Version 1.10 - July 30, 2012
* Added 'lineHeight' to the list of styles considered for size detection.

### Version 1.9 - June 19, 2012
* Added 'textIndent' to the list of styles considered for size detection.
* Added vender prefixes to box-sizing detection

### Version 1.8 - June 7, 2012
* Added conditional so that autosize cannot be applied twice to the same element
* When autosize is applied to an element, it will have a data property that links it to the mirrored textarea element.  This will make it easier to keep track of and remove unneeded mirror elements.  Example:

    $('textarea.example').data('mirror').remove(); // delete the mirror

    $('textarea.example').remove(); // delete the original

### Version 1.7 - May 3, 2012
* Now supports box-sizing:border-box

### Version 1.6 - February 11, 2012
* added binding to allow autosize to be triggered manually.  Example:
  $('#myTextArea').trigger('autosize');

### Version 1.5 - December 7, 2011
* fixed a regression in detecting FireFox support

### Version 1.4 - November 22, 2011

### Version 1.3 - November 13, 2011

### Version 1.2 - November 10, 2011

### Version 1.1 - November 10, 2011
